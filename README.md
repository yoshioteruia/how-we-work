# How we work

Welcome to tracersoft, this will guide you through our development process and give tips that you will need later.


######Things you need to know before starting:

* We are a flat organization with very high standards
* We work mostly with Ruby on Rails apps, on Heroku infrastructure.
* Write nice code is mandatory, we follow this convention: http://github.com/tracersoft/guides
* You will work with a small team, usually 3 devs. So, you have to be good on communication and acceptable with feedback!
* eXtreme Programming: http://www.desenvolvimentoagil.com.br/xp/
* Red, Green, Refactor: you must know or learn TDD.
* We have free fridays. Clients usually test features, which are developed over the week, on fridays. But "free" does not mean like a "lazy day", it is a day in which we can learn new things, develop side projects or contribute to open source projects.
